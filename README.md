"# Synchronising_automata" 
This program is written in C# and could be compiled under Visual Studio 2019
The goal: to implement a greedy algorithm for finding a syncronizing word for 
 determininistic finite automaton (DFA).
 The definition of an automaton could be described in one of 2 possible formats
 After input a defintion the program finds a syncronizing word
 Also the program can finds a syncronizing word for Cerny automaton
